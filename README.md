**Haskell and Cryptocurrencies Notes**

Course offered by IOG, you can find accompanying information within the builders / pioneers announcements @ the IOG discord technical server.

**Authors Note**

Having had some experience with Haskell as an undergraduate (a few years ago now), I realise (having taken the Plutus Pioneer Program) that I had only really scratched the surface. Thus, I reconsidered my goals, went back and undertook the introduction to Function Programming course provided by the University of Edinburgh (which I rate extremely highly).

Having taken a brief look at the lecture slides found within Haskell and Cryptocurrencies, it appears that the course assumes that you're able to pick up functional languages with ease, or have SOME experience with functional languages and or Haskell. The overview of Haskell opens with some fairly non-trivial language features, including notion related to Data Constructors, Type Constructors and functions. Being comfortable with these language constructs, types and general syntax has mainly come from the undertaking of "Introduction to Functional Programming" which is a free and open course by the University of Edinburgh. Thus, if you're refamiliarising yourself with this language after a LONG time (or you're a beginner), it may be a good idea to review some of these concepts (and the syntax) before hand.

*I am about to start this course, I will update this README as I make some progress through the course. As always, my thanks to the course organisers, lecturers and TAs: Lars Brünjes, Andres Löh and Alejandro García.*

**Footnotes**

1. I am still working my way through these lectures and making lecture notes, as I was fortunate enough to be temporarily enrolled on that course during my time at the University of Edinburgh, thus I was able to retain the teaching materials which, unfortunately, I cannot share. I can, however, share my notes which are listed below.
