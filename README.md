# haskell-notes | README.md

*These are my own notes, so take them for what they are. For instance, there may be some misleading details if I have misunderstood something; as far as learning materials go, these notes are here mainly as a source of 'self-help' - I tend to learn best through writing (or typing) things down and following exercises.*

**Haskell and Cryptocurrencies Notes**

Course offered by IOG, you can find accompanying information within the builders / pioneers announcements @ the IOG discord technical server.

**Code Examples**

1. [Basic Propositional Logic Implementation (prop.hs)](code_examples/prop.hs)
2. [Boilerplate Code For GHCi | Week One (week1.hs)](code_examples/week1.hs)
3. [Attempt #1 @ week1 exercise, TODO: come back to this](code_examples/intro.hs)

**Authors Note**

Having had some experience with Haskell as an undergraduate (a few years ago now), I realise (having taken the Plutus Pioneer Program) that I had only really scratched the surface. Thus, I reconsidered my goals, went back and undertook the introduction to Function Programming course provided by the University of Edinburgh (which I rate extremely highly).

*I am about to start this course, I will update this README as I make some progress through the course. As always, my thanks to the course organisers, lecturers and TAs: Lars Brünjes, Andres Löh and Alejandro García.*

#### Other Courses I Have Undertaken (recently):

* Plutus Pioneer Program Cohort Two - officially | 2021
* Introduction to Functional Programming (INF1A) - unofficially | 2018
* Blockchains and Distributed Ledgers (BDL)<sup>1</sup> - unofficially | 2020

**Footnotes**

1. I am still working my way through these lectures and making lecture notes, as I was fortunate enough to be temporarily enrolled on that course during my time at the University of Edinburgh, thus I was able to retain the teaching materials which, unfortunately, I cannot share. I can, however, share my notes which are listed below.
